## Project Summary
For our final project, we decided to focus on university statistics that include acceptance GPA, SAT/ACT test scores, tuition, ethnicity, and more. We can all relate to this topic as we all went through the college application process. It is stressful, time consuming, and requires research when coming to the ultimate decision of choosing where you'll be studying for four years. Our goal for this project is to help high school students make better decisions when applying to universities, and having more confidence that they'll be accepted when applying. In addition, we want to take the information about these universities and condense it into different data visuals, so students will be able to compare multiple universities at the same time. Our first data was sourced from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/theriley106/report" >Kaggle by Christopher Lambert</a>, who got the infromation from US-News. Our second data is sourced from the <a href = "https://ed-public-download.app.cloud.gov/downloads/Most-Recent-Cohorts-All-Data-Elements.csv" >College Scorecard</a>, this  and was last updated in June 2017. Our third data was sourced from "https://www.kaggle.com/sumithbhongale/american-university-data-ipeds-dataset" >Kaggle by Sumit Bhongale</a> and was last updated in 2017.

## Focal Project Questions
Our project focuses on answering the following questions regarding college decisions:
  - Which schools are easier to get in to?
  - Which schools cost the most to attend? which ones cost the least?
  - Which schools rank highest based on student statistics (GPA, Ethnicity, SAT, etc...)
  
To help high school students answer the first question when going through the application process, we created a summary table that outlines the average GPA, test scores, and etc... With this information condensed into one table and plot, students are able to easily compare their statistics with the universities to make better judgements about whether or not they should apply, and have higher acceptance rates if they choose universities within their reach.

For the second question, we wanted to help students understand how much money they are spending on their education. We all know that college can be expensive, and planning out your financials before attending a university is important. We want to help students plan for whether or not they will need to take out a loan or apply for more scholarships to attend the university of their choice. The tuition data we used to answer this question is based on in-state and out-of-state tuition. On the visualization, students will be able to choose in or out-of-state tuiton.

Finally, for the third question we wanted to rank the universities based on ethnicity, GPA, test scores, and more to provide additional information to further help students choose which universities to apply for. We have created a scatterplot based on university academics data that will allow the user to see which universities have high or lower academic performances. As well as a pie chart that uses the unversities ethnicity data to breakdown each ethnic population.

When creating these different visualizations, we combined all three data sources based on the university name, and sorted the data based on different variables that we were looking for.
