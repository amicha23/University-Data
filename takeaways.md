## Major Takeaways From This Project
***

### Tuition Information
In visualizing the average tuition costs by state we aimed to provide perspective students insight into where the most and least expersive schools are typically located. Based on both in-state and out-of-state costs, schools along the eastcoast, such as Washington D.C., Connecticut, and Massachusetts typically average the highest tuition costs. Based on this knowledge, it may be valuable for students looking at schools in these areas to start looking into scholarship opportunties to decrease their education costs. Furthermore, the schools with the lowest in-state and out-of-state tuition averages were located in Missouri, Wyoming, and North Dakota. 


### Academic Information
What we hoped to gain out of this information was which schools in each state are easier to get in to and which schools are harder to get in to. In all, we found that the majority of places like Massachusetts and New York, with their Ivy League schools, had some of the lowest acceptance rates, and some of the highest overall SAT, ACT, and high school GPAs in all of the United States. If students, in all, want to attend these schools, then they must strive for success in their four years of high school and get beyond stellar grades in order to stand a chance for admissions in these schools.

### Ethnicity Information
By make visualization of average ratio of ethnicity in each state, we hope to provide students information about how diversity differ depends on which states that university is located on. Based on diversity rate, some states in south west coast such as CA and east coast states has higher average diversity rate than other states and central part tends have higher concentration of white race. In Washington states, white race has the highest rate in ratio. However other race is distributed almost equally. This will show students which state is the best for them based on the ethnic diversity of the students of the schools in that state.
